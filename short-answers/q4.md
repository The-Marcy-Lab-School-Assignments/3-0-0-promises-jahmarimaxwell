# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
The arguments passed into either `resolve()` or `reject()` is what will be returned after the promise is either resolved or rejected. For example, this promise will return the str that was passed into the function when the promise rejected.
```jsx
const rejectedWrapper = (str) => {
  const promise = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject(Error(str));
  })
  return promise;
};
```

This is an incomplete answer, can you explain what you mean by "to be resolved/rejected from the promise." Think about when the promise is consumed, where is the `.then` callback getting its value from?
