# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
The arguments passed into either `resolve()` or `reject()` is what will be the output after the promise is either resolved or rejected. For example, this promise will return the str that was passed into the function when the promise rejected.
```jsx
const rejectedWrapper = (str) => {
  const promise = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject(Error(str));
  })
  return promise;
};
```
