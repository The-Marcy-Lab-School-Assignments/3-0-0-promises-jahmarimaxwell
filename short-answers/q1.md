# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
Outside promise will log to the console first because it is synchronous code, meaning it does not have to wait for to be resolved. Synchronous code will always run before asynchronous code. 
Asynchronous code waits for something to be completed (in this case, a promise) and then logs to the console.
