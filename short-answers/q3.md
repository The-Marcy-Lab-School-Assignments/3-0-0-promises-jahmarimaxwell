# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
calling `resolve()` or `reject()` will produce a value when called. It does not need to be returned. You can return the entire promise to see the value.

There is no need to return in a promise. It will produce the value regardless. Just want to add that we are only focused on the the resolve and reject functions.
