# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
calling and returning the promise will produce a value. Without return in front of a `new promise` syntax, it will return undefined.

There is no need to return in a promise. It will produce the value regardless.
